# gabarit_LaTeX_sciences_humaines
This repository contains a complete LaTeX project structure that consists of a template for social and human sciences. Since templates available online are often made for natural sciences like physics, mathematics or biology, I decided to take one and modify it to better fit the format of a social/human sciences paper.
