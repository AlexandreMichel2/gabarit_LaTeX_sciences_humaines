# Gabarit LaTeX pour les sciences humaines et sociales

This repository contains a complete LaTeX project structure that consists of a template for social and human sciences. Since templates
available online are often made for natural sciences like physics, mathematics or biology, I decided to take one and modify it to better fit the format of a social/human sciences paper.

It is written in french, but it would be usable for any language if the proper changes are made to the "Formatage.sty" file (most notably for the Babel package). The ".sty" file can also be fully customized by anyone who wants to use this as a base template to create their ownÂ !
